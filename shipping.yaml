# Shipping service is responsible for finding the distance of the package to be shipped and calculate the price based on that.
# Shipping service is written in Java, Hence we need to install Java.
# Maven is a Java Packaging software, Hence we are going to install maven, This indeed takes care of java installation.
# Developer has chosen Maven, Check with developer which version of Maven is needed. Here for our requirement java >= 1.8 & maven >=3.5 should work.

# ✅ What is system:?

    # This marks the user as a system-level user, not a normal human user.
    # System users are created for running services or background processes.

# ❌ Why we don’t use path: here:

    # 🔺 path: is not a valid option in the user module.
    # path: is used in (file) or (copy) modules
    # But in the user module, there’s no such field as path.

# 🗣️ In Telugu:

    # home: ane field lo manam ee user ki base folder ekkada undalo cheptam. Example: (files) or (logs) store cheyataniki.
